Getting Started

Prerequisites

Node.js & npm installed

Local Setup

# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/PranavPatil-45/React-Main-Project.git
cd React-Main-Project

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run the JSON server (if using)
# json-server --watch db.json --port 3001

Notes

The app fetches product data from fakestoreapi.com or from a locally hosted JSON server.

Uses react-toastify for displaying success/error notifications.

Bootstrap is used for styling (via class names only, no CSS overrides) for a clean and responsive UI.
